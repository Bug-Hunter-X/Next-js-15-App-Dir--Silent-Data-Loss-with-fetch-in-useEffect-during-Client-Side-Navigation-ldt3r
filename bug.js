In Next.js 15, a particularly unusual bug can occur when using the `app` directory's `fetch` API within a component's `useEffect` hook combined with client-side routing.  The issue arises when navigating between routes that trigger multiple fetches. If the component unmounts before a fetch completes, and then remounts rapidly with a new fetch call, the previous fetch's promise might resolve later, but the component is no longer mounted to handle the response.  This leads to a silent failure, with the data never reaching the component, despite seemingly no errors being thrown.
